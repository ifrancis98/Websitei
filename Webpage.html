    <p style="font-size: 40px">Juno is a NASA New Frontiers mission currently orbiting the planet Jupiter. Juno was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011 and arrived on July 4, 2016.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 40px">Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars.</p>

   </h3><center>
<ul>
  <li>Determine how much water is in Jupiter's atmosphere, which helps determine which planet formation theory is correct (or if new theories are needed).</li>
  <li>Look deep into Jupiter's atmosphere to measure composition, temperature, cloud motions and other properties.</li>
  <li>Map Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields, revealing the planet's deep structure.</li>
  <li>Explore and study Jupiter's magnetosphere near the planet's poles, especially the auroras – Jupiter's northern and southern lights – providing new insights about how the planet's enormous magnetic force field affects its atmosphere.</li>
  </ul>
